# udacity-ds-project1
## Purpose of the project
This project involves creating a compelling blog post on a dataset of our choice while following a CRISP-DM framework of analysis

## Motivation
Understanding the trends of interstate migration is crucial because it impacts economic growth, tax revenue growth, cost of living and a host of other factors. This is an analysis that attempts to study the trends of interstate migration

## Files in the repository
1. UDProject1.ipynb - A Jupyter Notebook file which has the code and visualizations for the analysis
2. Readme.md - A readme file showing all the relevant details of the project
3. 1112inmigall.csv to 1718inmigall.csv - 7 CSV files which together constitute the dataset for this project

## Libraries used:
1. NumPy, Pandas - For creating and manipulating dataframes and using in-built functions and features for data manipulation
2. Matplotlib - For generating plots and various data visualizations
3. Seaborn - A wrapper for matplotlib that generates compelling visualizations
4. Plotly - A library that helps generate interactive plots and visualizations, here used to generate choropleths
5. warnings - To suppress any warnings so that the Python notebook is clean and free of errors/warnings

## Key findings:
1. Northeast and midwest regions experiencing the highest net outflow of people
2. The outflow includes both young and old people and increases with increasing income
3. The states experiencing the highest outflows are CA, NY, IL; the states experiencing highest inflows are TX, FL, WA, OR
